# C-Basic

These are the basics of C that I learned in the 1st semester of year 2.

The knowledge is related to practice with basic data structures such as single association, tree, queue, stack,... the manipulating files, sorting functions, searching function

Knowledge is spread throughout the week, from week 1 to week 14.
In addition, there are 3 folders for previous years' exam questions
